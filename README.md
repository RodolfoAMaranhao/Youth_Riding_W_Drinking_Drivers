# Youth_Riding_W_Drinking_Drivers

In this project we will analyze the risk of high schoolers riding with drinking drivers by examining a dataset from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in the U.S. Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine learning, we should identify factors contributing to this behavior and use the insights gained to develop preventive measures.
